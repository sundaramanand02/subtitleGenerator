00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:3,680 
 That's called a manga, father! It's like the book version of an anime! 

2 
00:00:3,680 --> 00:00:5,680 
 Why are the pages stuck together? 

3 
00:00:5,680 --> 00:00:7,180 
 Ahhhh! 

4 
00:00:7,180 --> 00:00:14,600 
 On today's episode of Brutally Honest, we meet Desmond, a 30-year-old man suffering a severe anime addiction. 

5 
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,000 
 From what I'm told, Desmond's anime addiction caused an issue at his church recently. 

6 
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,280 
 None are more powerful than Jesus Christ! 

7 
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,280 
 There is no way he's beating Goku! 

8 
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280 
 Oh! 

9 
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280 
 What? 

10 
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,280 
 You need to leave! 

11 
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,280 
 Desmond's father opted to send him to controversial therapist Dr. Victor Blaine as a last-ditch effort to help him. 

12 
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760 
 As you can see, Dr. Blaine, my son is out of control, and I don't know what to do. 

13 
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,260 
 I would start with confiscating that pillow. 

14 
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,260 
 I'll try to take it from him once. 

15 
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,760 
 But when I picked it up, it was as hard as a rock! 

16 
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760 
 Wow! 

17 
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,760 
 I think someone should probably check Desmond's hard drive. 

18 
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,760 
 Desmond, get that pillow off of my couch. It smells. 

19 
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760 
 That pillow is my girlfriend! 

20 
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760 
 And her name is Miku.
